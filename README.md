[DevOpsLinks](http://devopslinks.com): Join more than 1000 passionate DevOps and IT experts from all over the world.

DevOpsLinks is a project that I started to gather a community of passionate developers and system engineers interested in modern apps and DevOps culture and technologies. I am convinced that this kind of communities and the sharing culture between its members is one of the best ways to learn new skills. The project started in March 2016 and started with a weekly newsletter, today the number of subscribers is growing each day and we have an active Slack team chat.

We believe in sharing: "Unshared knowledge is knowledge wasted" and DevOps For Fun & Profit. Mutual respect between members is important. We are pragmatic and are promoting resolutions rather than conflicts.

Some facts, during 2016:

1000+ subscribers 700+ shared links 20,570 delivered emails
Most discussed subjects are:

Docker Kubernetes Docker Swarm Amazon Web Services Ansible
